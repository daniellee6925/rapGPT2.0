- **Tokenization**: Hugging Face GPT-2 tokenizer with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

### Training Configuration

- **Optimizer**: AdamW
- **Epochs**: *[Your value here]*
- **Batch Size**: *[Your value here]*
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss
- **Hardware**: Trained on NVIDIA RTX 4080 and AWS EC2

### Request Body

```json
{
  "prompt": "Feels so empty wihtout me",
  "temperature": 0.9,
  "top_k": 50,
  "top_p": 0.95,
  "max_tokens": 80
}

### Response
